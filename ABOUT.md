##### Why Node JS ?
- I choose Node JS language because it is the most familiar language to me , since it is javascript.

##### Things I learned:
- It is the first time to build a project as front end and back end from A-Z which is good to me.
- It is the first time to use Node JS in a project, I have a background but I have never build a project in this langauge before. 
- Using Heroku for the first time was very intersting to learn.

##### Steps I follow in thinking:
1. Analyze the JSON data and choose specific keys for searching.
2. Try to use one function to get a data from server.
3. What data should be displayed on the offer card.
4. What back end language should I use.
